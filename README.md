# Singular Value Decomposition for prevention of the Graph Convolutional Network overfitting

The project focuses on improving the Graph Con-
volutional Networks (GCNs) performance. These
networks  became  a  quite  common  method  for
graph representation learning and are widely used
in a variety of real-world applications. However,
GCNs are typically shallow, with the number of
layers not more than two. Greater depth usually
leads to network overfitting,  oversmoothing or
even an inability to learn, where the application
of standard methods like dropout and weight pe-
nalizing does not help.  In this work we explore
certain techniques that allow the construction of
deeper networks and preserve the ability of net-
work to train effectively.
